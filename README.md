# Monthly UI Projects

These are my 2025 monthly projects I have completed. Its where design meets code. I wanted to do these projects while learning more about React.js and Tailwind CSS. With the mindset of getting use to coding in React and styling in Tailwind CSS, grasping concepts like flex, grid, hierchy and just the structure in general when it comes to building these projects.

This journey started off having fun, coding and I'm going to contine on doing that. Although I stopped doing these UI projects, so I can focus on bigger things, it is something I'll always remember.
