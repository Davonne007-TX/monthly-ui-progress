# Monthly 2025 UI Projects

These are my 2025 monthly projects I have completed. Its where design meets code. Since I love both design and code.

I wanted to do these projects while learning more about React.js and Tailwind CSS. With the mindset of leveling up in React.js learning core concepts, such as props, passing down props, components, reuseable components, responsive design, mapping, arrays and more..! Of course having fun styling in Tailwind CSS, grasping concepts like flex, grid, hierarchy and just the structure in general when it comes to building these projects.

Although I slowed down on these projects so I can focus on bigger projects, it is something I'll always remember and a project to look back on when I need guidance.
