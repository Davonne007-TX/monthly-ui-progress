# Monthly UI Projects

These are my monthly projects I have completed. Its where design meets code. I wanted to do these projects while learning more about React.js and Tailwind CSS. With the mindset of getting use to coding in React and styling and concepts like flex, grid, and just the structure in general when it comes to building these projects.

This journey started off having fun, coding and I'm going to contine on doing that. Although I stopped doing these UI projects, so I can focus on bigger projects, it is something I'll always remember.
